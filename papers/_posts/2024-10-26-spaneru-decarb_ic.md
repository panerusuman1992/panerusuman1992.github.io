Given the urgent need for decarbonization of the construction industry due to its pivotal role in global greenhouse gas emissions,industrialized construction (IC) has emerged as a promising technique to change the productivity, quality, and sustainability of construction.Although some evidence and case studies reveal that IC has distinct decarbonization advantages compared with traditional construction, there still is a need to analyze best practices, opportunities, and challenges in order to guide industry practitioners and to define key knowledge gaps. A systematic review was conducted following the three core steps: database search; research gap identification, analysis according tokey lifecycle stages, and decarbonization themes. This synthesized existing academic works at the intersection of industrialized constructionand decarbonization to provide a comprehensive understanding of decarbonization in IC. The findings show that although a significant amount of research focused on emissions during project stages A1–A3, there is a noticeable research gap in evaluating the carbon emissions associated with transportation, operations, and end-of-life attributes of IC. Moreover, the absence of real-time assessments during the B6–B7operational stages impedes optimal carbon emission assessment. The verbosity of carbon estimation and tracking methodologies alsoadds challenges to ensuring that additional carbon impacts of IC are adequately offset by improved efficiency and lower onsite emissions.The potential of decarbonization of IC can be explored further by future research on the standardization of life-cycle assessments, development of continuous carbon-tracking methodologies, and application of alternative materials and new technologies.

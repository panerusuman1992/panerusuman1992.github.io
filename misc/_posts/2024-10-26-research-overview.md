The **Paneru Building Lab** aims to develop **clean, resilient, and equitable
energy systems** at the nexus of **built and natural environments** to support the well-being of humans and ecosystems.

Our research advances fundamental scientific knowledge in **building physics** and **system-thinking** via **computational modeling and simulation** methods while advancing the carbon neutrality and eco-friendliness of our built environment. 

Our expertise includes advanced energy systems (buildings, districts, cities), environmental **life cycle assessment**, and human-centric **design thinking**.

 
Please see our **[papers]** and **[tools]** pages for examples across these exciting research avenues.

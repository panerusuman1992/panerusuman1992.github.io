Welcome to the **Paneru Building Lab** at the University XX ! 
The Paneru Building Lab works at the intersection of built and natural environments to design and deploy 
innovative energy system technologies that are sustainable, resilient, and equitable. 

To do this, we adopt **computational modeling and simulation** and **system-level thinking** methods  to address
**complex energy system challenges** for society. 

Our expertise lies in **building physics**  integreated envelope and system, including HVAC systems 
and controls. 

[//]: # (Some of the fundamental scientific questions we study include:) 

We frequently work with **real communities** to improve their system design and operation.
